## 1.  Requirement Gathering And Planning :
- In the requirement gathering step, we understand the problem statement and
set the goals for the data analysis task. Here, we try to get answers to the
following questions:
Why do we need data analysis? What is the business domain of the problem
statement? What type of data analysis should we apply? What data do we
need to deal with? What are the possible challenges/gaps with data? And
how to overcome those?
So, this phase is for understanding/brainstorming the problem statement and
its domain and then creating/planning the roadmap for the data analysis
process.
## 2. Data Collection :
  - In this step, we will collect data from different sources (From the web, some
transactional systems, data from users in flat files or data from sensors or
machines, and so on). In data collection, only collecting the data is not
enough, but the timing of data (at which time and how frequent) is also
essential. So, always consider this point while going for the data collection
step.
## 3.Data cleaning:
- The data collected at the data collection step is raw; it may have some
corrupt, irrelevant, or dirty data. For example, it may have white spaces,
quotes, inconsistencies, corrupted records, or some part/records of that
collected data that are irrelevant to our problem.
So, here, we will detect and remove the corrupted, inaccurate, and irrelevant
data from the collected raw data set and build a cleaner subset from that.
## 4.Data preparation:
- Here, at this data preparation step, we manipulate the data and add the
required derived variable (columns/fields) to make it ready for accurate and
consistent data analysis. For example, suppose we have a userâ€™s contact
number with the country code (like +91-1234567890); now, if we split this
into two columns, contact_number (124567890) and country (India), here,
the country is a derived column.
## 5.Data analysis:
- We will analyze previously prepared data by following the finalized
approach and plan, which we decided at the requirements gathering and
planning step. Here, we do data analysis with the help of a data analysis
framework, tools, and utilities like Excel, R, SAS, Python, Hadoop, Spark,
and so on.
## 6.Data interpretation and result summarization:
- This is where we will interpret the results from the data analysis step and
build the conclusion by summarizing the findings.
## 7.Data visualization
Data visualization is the final step. Here, we will represent our findings and
conclusion graphically with the help of an appropriate visual plot, like Bar
Charts, Histograms, Pie charts, and so on.
Also, we must communicate the data analysis insights in Reports/Dashboards
with the higher management for their review and information.
